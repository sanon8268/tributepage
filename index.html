        <h1>Early Life & Education</h1>
        <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
            father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a
            housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now
            uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors
            had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even
            though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the
            1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal
            Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had
            involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as
            ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add
            to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
            businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.
        </p>

        <p>
            After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
            Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government
            of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He
            started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
            Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.
            In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project
            director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
            satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
            independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme
            to include more engineers.

        <h1>Personal Life</h1>
        <p>
            Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d.1997), followed by
            three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 &boxh; 7 March 2021), Mustafa
            Kalam (d.1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d.1995). He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended
            families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older relations, himself
            remaining a lifelong bachelor. <br>
            Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He never owned a television, and was in the
            habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m. His few personal possessions included his books,
            his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left no will, and his
            possessions went to his eldest brother, who survived him.

        <p class="secondryp">
            On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at
            the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some
            discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five
            minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical
            condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive
            care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide
            Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"<br>

            Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati,
            from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight
            landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, the Prime
            Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces,
            who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and
            taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage,
            including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul
            Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. <br>

            On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown
            to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was
            received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet
            ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya,
            K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to
            the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving
            at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public
            to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening. <br>

            On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state
            honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil
            Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.
